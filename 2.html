<h1 align =center>2. There are 175+ languages in the country</h1>
<p>There are at least 175 languages spoken in the Philippines and at least 171 of them are considered ‘living’ languages. You’ll have no trouble being understood though since more than 52 million people speak English, making it the fifth largest English-speaking nation in the world.

Other languages include Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano, Hiligaynon and Bicolano, as well as four tribal dialects that are not known to have any living speakers.</p>
