<h1 align =center>6. Jeepneys are still the most popular mode of transport</h1>
<p>Jeepneys are synonymous with the Philippines. After World War II, American troops left behind thousands of surplus Jeeps. Resourceful Filipinos cobbled these together and converted them into transport vehicles that can hold up to 20 people at one time. Theyâ€™re easy to spot, usually painted in vibrant colours with slogans emblazoned across them.

Jeepneys are slowly being phased out to ease congestion in the city, in favour of more environmentally-friendly alternatives. But, there are still plenty ploughing through the streets so you should have time to hop on an iconic piece of history.</p>
